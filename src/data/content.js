  "When I started in software engineering, one quote from Linus Torvalds stuck with me: \"Talk is cheap — show me the code.\" Today, everyone is a builder, I'd rephrase it as: \"Talk is cheap — show me what you built.\"",
  "For the last five years, I've advocated for project-based learning for developers worldwide—the only way to truly learn is by doing. And there's never been a better time to build than now, with the lines between engineer, designer, and product manager blurred, and AI as an essential tool for every builder.",
  "Vibe research, then vibe code, then iterate. Don't just build for the sake of building—solve real user problems. Use AI for research, but validate with real human conversations.",
  "Decision-first, data-second. We live in the most data-rich era, but great outcomes start with clarity on the decisions you want to make—then find the data that matters.",
  "Think in systems. Even if you're not technical, learn how systems work. Understand system design and, more importantly, where \"vibecoding\" ends and human expertise is required.",
  "Make yourself superhuman. Use AI to upgrade your workflows, remove bottlenecks, and move fast. AI isn't magic—it's leverage, and knowing how to wield it makes all the difference."
